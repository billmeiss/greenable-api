All fields are required.
format, reportingPeriod, standardUnit, and notes fields must be strings.
containsRelevantData must be a boolean.
confidence.overall and all other confidence scores must be numbers from 0-10.
missingData and potentialErrors must be arrays of strings.
All emission values (scope1.value, scope2.locationBased.value, scope2.marketBased.value, scope3.total.value, and category values) must be non-zero numbers.
scope3.includedCategories and scope3.missingCategories must be arrays of strings.
The included field for each category must be a boolean.

Note: For scope3.categories, include entries for all 15 categories following the same structure as category 1.

IMPORTANT: A report is only considered to contain relevant data (containsRelevantData = true) if it has non-zero numerical values for any of the following:
- scope1.value
- scope2.locationBased.value
- scope2.marketBased.value
- scope3.total.value

If any of these values are missing, zero, or non-numerical, containsRelevantData must be set to false.`;
